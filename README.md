# tex2mml

A library for converting TeX/LaTeX math to Presentation MathML

A large subset of TeX/LaTeX math commands is supported. See the file 'tables.cpp' for more information.

Compile the following files to create a '.lib' file that you can link to your application: classes.cpp, parser.cpp, and tables.cpp.

See 'example.cpp' on how to use this library. For your convenience, 64-bit .lib files are provided (debug and release versions).
